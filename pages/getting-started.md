lead: The SAM Web Design Standards extend the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/">US Web Design Standards</a>.
---

<p>For more information on why we chose the US Web Design Standards as a starting point, read the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/">blog post introducing the standards</a>.</p>

<p>As the Standards do not replace the US Web Design Standards, it is important to visit and become familiar with them.</p>

<h3 class="usa-heading">For developers</h3>

<p>The US Web Design Standards supplies front-end developers with UI components, creating a common HTML architecture. The SAM UI Kits allow front-end developers to write less code, and render those components (along with some extras we have created for our solution).</p>

<h4>CSS architecture:</h4>

<p>We avoid modifying the base CSS generated by the US Web Design Standards as much as possible; opting to contribute directly to that project through pull requests.</p>

<p>The SAM environment has a CSS available to developers, which captures the CSS generated by the US Web Standards with additional declarations added. The styles from the US Web Standards are prefixed with “usa-“ while those declared by IAE are prefixed with “iae-“. Therefore, when extending the available styles it is important to use a unique prefix to avoid collision.</p>

<h4>Mobile first:</h4>

SAM uses the [grid](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/grids/) established by the *US Web Standards* to create responsive designs[^ResponsiveDesign] with a mobile first mindset.
